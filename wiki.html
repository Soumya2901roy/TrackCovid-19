        <div class="text-center animate-box"><h6>2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China.
            Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.
            However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.
            The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo", which refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a crown.

        <h6>
            <ul>
            <li>
                The main route of transmission is respiratory droplets and close contact.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you sneeze or cough, you send out droplets of fluid from your nose and mouth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Those droplets can carry infections, and when they enter someone else's enter the eyes, nose
                or mouth, the infection can make them sick. This is the way the flu and many viruses are
                spread.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most often, you need to be close to the person (within 6 feet) for it to spread this way.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is the possibility of aerosol transmission when exposed to high concentration aerosol
                for a long time in a relatively closed environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The WHO has stated that the risk of spread from someone without symptoms is "very low" and
                that fecal transmission is "low".

                        pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. </p>

                            Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who
                            suspect they have been infected.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Public health agencies have issued self-isolation instructions that include notification of
                            healthcare providers by phone and restricting all activities outside of the home, except for
                            getting medical care.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing,
                            or taxis

                            Those who have recently travelled to a country with widespread transmission or who have been in direct contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 have also been asked by some government health agencies to self-quarantine or practise social distancing for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Attempts to relieve the symptoms may include taking regular (over-the-counter) cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting. Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.

                        <li>
                            The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.

                                By early March 2020, 30 vaccine candidates were in development, with products by Gilead Sciences and Ascletis Pharma in Phase III clinical trials.
